Create your own cryptocurrency with Solidity

In this step-by-step tutorial, you will learn how to create and deploy an "ERC-20".
Token in Ethereum.

Here we will use Metamask and Remix IDE

**PREREQUISITIES**

Make sure you have downloaded Metamask in your web browser.

In Metamask set its network as Goerli Testnet network.

Then get some Goerli testnet ether from any of the faucets found below.

**WRITING THE CODE**

We use Remix to write the smart contract.

Create a new contract file. And name it whatever you want. I'm LW3Token. I named it left.

After the code is written, compile it. Make sure you choose the right compiler at these stages.

Then, select Environment **injected web3** from **Deploy & Run transactions** sections and make sure your Metamask account is in the Goerli Test Network and connected to your Metamask wallet.

After specifying the name and symbol of your cryptocurrency in the Deploy section, press the transact button. And wait a while for Metamask to deploy it.

After being deployed, copy your smart contract address from the deployed contracts section.

Then go to the Metamask web browser extension and click the import tokens button in the assets section. Enter the contract address you copied and press the add button. Here is your balance in Metamask!
